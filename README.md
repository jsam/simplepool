# simplepool

This library implements worker crew model with Go routines. It maintains multiple
routines waiting for tasks to be allocated for concurrent execution by the supervising program.

To configure how much CPU you program will consume for computation use Golangs runtime library:

```
runtime.GOMAXPROCS(numCPUs)
```

## Instalation

```
go get github.com/jsam/simplepool
```

## How to use
